Imagine a speculative scifi machine using only the parts from today's labs. First of all, the circuit I designed controls the brightness of the red and blue LED lights through two switches. But it cannot be on or off at the same time. In my opinion, since the birth of civilization and law, the world has been pursuing a fairness and authenticity that tends to be 100% infinite. People hope that the world can be black and white. Everything is getting better in today's society, but lies still cannot be avoided. Sometimes the lie is because of selfishness and wanting to achieve a certain purpose, sometimes just to not hurt other people. Some people are born with stronger empathy and are more likely to be hurt by the words of others.
 
I want to use this design as a preliminary model to derive a wearable bracelet, and people can control the information that can be heard through buttons (maybe later learning can also use sensing devices according to psychological changes). When the red light comes on,The wearer will hear a specially generated language, not sound, but transmitted to him through the bracelet. people can automatically filter out useless and deceptive information to focus more on their own affairs. When the blue light is on, people can listen to all messages.  People wearing the same bracelet can form an interaction and automatically generate a special language for communication. This special language can avoid the existing language damage.

Some people may not need it very much, but people with social sensitivity and social phobia may need it more. The reason why my idea is to design a wearable design is because while shielding and receiving information by themselves, others can also observe the emotions and psychological states of others through the lighting of red and blue lights. Timely grasp the social dimension. Perhaps we will never be able to absolutely guarantee the fairness and truth of the world. The red and blue lights cannot be on and off at the same time, which also shows that we cannot always be in a no-manâ€™s world, and we must always receive voices from everywhere. . We always have to choose a way to listen. As I said at the beginning, lies are not only bad things, my thoughts are also just to help socially sensitive people get out of trouble.!
